      <p className="mb-2 font-medium">("Hirer Terms," "Terms of Service," or "Agreement")</p>
      <p className="mb-6 text-sm text-muted-foreground">Version 1.1 &nbsp; Effective Date: July 15, 2025</p>
      <p className="mb-4">These Terms of Service form a legally binding contract between FeeldZone Inc. ("FeeldZone," "we," "us," or "our"), a Colorado corporation with its principal place of business at [Insert Address], and the entity or individual that creates a Hirer account or otherwise uses the FeeldZone platform to request or purchase services ("Hirer," "you," or "your").</p>
      <p className="mb-4">By clicking “I Agree,” creating an account, submitting a posting, or otherwise accessing or using the FeeldZone website or mobile application (collectively, the “Platform”), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by (i) these Terms and (ii) FeeldZone’s Privacy Policy (incorporated here by reference). If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">1. Definitions</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>“Job”</strong> – A request or posting by a Hirer for services to be performed by a Professional.</li>
        <li><strong>“Professional”</strong> – An independent contractor enrolled on the Platform and bound by FeeldZone’s Independent Contractor Agreement (“ICA”).</li>
        <li><strong>“Work Order”</strong> – The electronic confirmation generated through the Platform that specifies Job details, dates, scope, and pricing mutually agreed between Hirer and Professional.</li>
        <li><strong>“Service Fee(s)”</strong> – Fees, commissions, or other charges payable to FeeldZone for use of the Platform, as displayed at checkout or otherwise disclosed in writing.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">2. Scope; FeeldZone’s Role</h2>
      <p className="mb-2"><strong>2.1 Marketplace Venue.</strong> FeeldZone is a neutral marketplace that enables Hirers and Professionals to discover, communicate, and transact. FeeldZone is not a general contractor, staffing agency, or employer of Professionals and is not a party to any Work Order.</p>
      <p className="mb-2"><strong>2.2 No Endorsement or Warranty.</strong> FeeldZone may perform limited onboarding checks, but we do not guarantee licensure, insurance, qualifications, or performance of any Professional. You are solely responsible for vetting each Professional.</p>
      <p className="mb-2"><strong>2.3 Limited Payment Agent.</strong> You authorize FeeldZone to (a) collect amounts owed to Professionals and any Service Fees owed to FeeldZone, and (b) remit those amounts to the proper recipients. Payment to FeeldZone is deemed payment to the Professional.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>2.4 Independent Contractor Relationship.</strong> By engaging a Professional you acknowledge that:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>the Professional is an independent contractor, not your employee, partner, joint-venturer, or agent;</li>
        <li>you control only the desired results, not the means or methods of the Professional’s work;</li>
        <li>you provide no employee benefits; and</li>
        <li>FeeldZone bears no liability for any worker-classification claim arising from your conduct.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">3. Account Registration & Security</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>3.1 Accurate Information.</strong> Provide and maintain true, current, and complete account information.</li>
        <li><strong>3.2 Authority.</strong> If registering on behalf of a business, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity.</li>
        <li><strong>3.3 Credentials.</strong> You are responsible for safeguarding login credentials and all activity under your account.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">4. Posting Jobs & Forming Work Orders</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>4.1 Job Details.</strong> Job postings must be lawful, accurate, and sufficiently detailed.</li>
        <li><strong>4.2 Formation.</strong> Acceptance of a Professional’s bid or offer through the Platform creates a binding Work Order between you and that Professional.</li>
        <li><strong>4.3 Changes.</strong> Scope, schedule, or price changes after formation must be agreed through the Platform or in writing by both parties.</li>
        <li><strong>4.4 Cancellation.</strong> Platform-posted cancellation terms apply. You may incur fees if you cancel after a Professional has mobilized.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">5. Fees, Payments & Taxes</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>5.1 Pricing.</strong> The total payable amount equals (a) the Professional’s charges plus (b) any FeeldZone Service Fees. All amounts are shown before you confirm a Work Order.</li>
        <li><strong>5.2 Payment Method.</strong> Maintain at least one valid payment method. FeeldZone (or its payment processor) may pre-authorize or capture funds per the schedule shown at checkout.</li>
        <li><strong>5.3 Disputes.</strong> To dispute workmanship, open a dispute through the Platform within seven (7) calendar days of the Professional’s completion notice, or funds may be automatically released.</li>
        <li><strong>5.4 Taxes.</strong> Prices exclude sales, use, VAT, or similar taxes unless stated. Where legally required, FeeldZone will collect and remit taxes; otherwise, you are responsible for any taxes due.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">6. Hirer Obligations & Conduct</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>6.1 Site Access & Safety.</strong> Provide lawful, safe access to the jobsite and disclose hazards.</li>
        <li><strong>6.2 Legal Compliance.</strong> Obtain required permits and comply with applicable laws and building codes.</li>
        <li><strong>6.3 Prohibited Conduct.</strong> You will not (a) post false or unlawful content; (b) request illegal services; (c) circumvent the Platform to avoid Service Fees; (d) harass, discriminate, or retaliate against Professionals; or (e) reverse-engineer or disrupt the Platform.</li>
        <li><strong>6.4 Non-Circumvention & Buy-Out.</strong> For the Term of this Agreement and twelve (12) months thereafter, you will not solicit or hire outside the Platform any Professional first contacted through the Platform. Breach triggers a Buy-Out Fee equal to US $5,000 or 25% of the Professional’s estimated first-year earnings—whichever is greater—which you agree is a reasonable pre-estimate of FeeldZone’s damages.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">7. Intellectual Property & Content</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>7.1 Platform IP.</strong> FeeldZone and its licensors own the Platform. No rights are granted except the limited right to use it under these Terms.</li>
        <li><strong>7.2 User Content.</strong> By posting content (e.g., reviews, project photos) you grant FeeldZone a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to use, display, and distribute that content for Platform purposes.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">8. Confidentiality & Privacy</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>8.1 Confidential Information.</strong> Use non-public information received through the Platform only as needed for a Job, and keep it confidential.</li>
        <li><strong>8.2 Privacy.</strong> Use of the Platform is subject to the FeeldZone Privacy Policy.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">9. Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>9.1 AS-IS Platform.</strong> The Platform is provided “AS IS” without warranties of any kind.</li>
        <li><strong>9.2 Professional Disclaimer.</strong> FeeldZone is not responsible for any act or omission of a Professional.</li>
        <li><strong>9.3 Liability Cap.</strong> FeeldZone’s total liability arising under these Terms will not exceed the greater of (i) Service Fees you paid to FeeldZone in the six (6) months preceding the claim or (ii) US $100.</li>
        <li><strong>9.4 Excluded Damages.</strong> FeeldZone will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages, or for lost profits, revenue, or data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">10. Indemnification</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless FeeldZone, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claim, damage, loss, or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li>your breach of these Terms or Section 2.4;</li>
        <li>your negligence or misconduct;</li>
        <li>bodily injury, death, or property damage occurring at your site or caused by you;</li>
        <li>any claim that your engagement of a Professional created an employment relationship or misclassification; or</li>
        <li>your violation of law or third-party rights.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">11. Dispute Resolution</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>11.1 Governing Law.</strong> Colorado law governs, excluding conflict-of-law rules.</li>
        <li><strong>11.2 Binding Arbitration.</strong> Any dispute will be resolved exclusively by final, binding arbitration before the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules in Denver, Colorado. Both parties waive jury trial rights. FeeldZone will advance the initial filing fee; the arbitrator may reallocate fees in the award.</li>
        <li><strong>11.3 Class Action Waiver.</strong> Disputes must be brought individually; class or representative actions are prohibited.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">12. Termination</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>12.1 By Hirer.</strong> Close your account anytime after all open Work Orders are completed or canceled and balances paid.</li>
        <li><strong>12.2 By FeeldZone.</strong> We may suspend or terminate your account for breach, suspected fraud, or as permitted by law.</li>
        <li><strong>12.3 Survival.</strong> Sections that by nature survive (including Confidentiality, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Dispute Resolution, and General Provisions) remain in effect.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">13. Changes to Terms</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">FeeldZone may amend these Terms by posting an updated version and providing at least fourteen (14) days’ notice via email or in-app. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance. Material changes do not apply to Work Orders accepted beforehand.</p>
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">14. General Provisions</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>14.1 Assignment.</strong> You may not assign these Terms without FeeldZone’s prior written consent; FeeldZone may assign freely.</li>
